		<para type="text">In his regular BBC Sport column, Robbie Savage looks at Aston Villa's 3-0 defeat by Manchester United on Sunday.</para>
		<para type="text">There has been a lot of criticism of United in recent weeks, so their manager David Moyes deserves credit for getting things right at Villa Park. A number of their players can take real positives away from the game.</para>
		<para type="text">But it helped Moyes a lot that Villa were so poor in pretty much every area of the pitch. In fact, they were awful.</para>

			<question>Under Paul Lambert, Villa's home form is terrible. They have only scored six times in eight home league games this season, and have lost five of them.</question>
			<answer>Why are they so bad? Well, every other pundit I listen to knows they are a counter-attacking side and other teams seem to have worked them out too. United definitely did.</answer>
			<question>Villa actually made a pretty good start on Sunday. They had six shots in the first five minutes and looked quite dangerous.</question>
			<answer>But that all changed as soon as Danny Welbeck scored twice in quick succession.</answer>
			<question>From then on, United were in control of the game and Rafael and Antonio Valencia tore Luna apart.</question>
			<answer>Almost half of their attacks came down that third of the pitch, while Wayne Rooney dropped deep and started spraying passes out wide too.</answer>

			<list-item>At the other end, they left no space for Villa to break into, which was the hosts' main tactic.</list-item>
			<list-item>In the first half, when they played the ball long up to Benteke, he was usually waiting for it on the left.</list-item>
			<list-item>But United's defence just dropped back and let their midfield deal with it. That meant their defence always won the second ball very easily</list-item>
